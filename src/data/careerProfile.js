  description: `<p>I believe that software development is a tool to improve human life.
  <p>I find software to be the most powerful way to share value In order to connect people and improve the quality of all our lives.</p>
  <p>Software engineering for me is like painting or sculpting, it’s a way to take a complicated and beautiful structure lay, connecting all the dots piece by piece, and create a masterpiece. It’s more than just art, it’s life.
  That’s why I wake up with a smile, and keep it on all day long. I am so lucky to be paid for doing what I love the most.
  <br>That’s what makes me a great engineer. <br>I’m not smarter than others, I just really care.</p>
  <p>I love what I do and do what I love, so I don’t play the nine to five game, I live it 24/7.
  This rush makes me develop community projects like Stunity and learn new paradigms and tools with the passion of a child getting a new toy running around and having fun without the need for any additional incentive.</p>
  I share my beliefs with others to inspire them, and some follow. I also learn from others. That’s what makes me a true leader.</p>`
